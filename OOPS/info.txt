Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to organize code. 
JavaScript supports OOP principles, although it has a prototype-based object system rather than the classical 
class-based system found in languages like Java or C++. Here are some key OOP concepts in JavaScript:

1. Objects
2. Classes
3. Inheritance
4. Encapsulation
5. Polymorphism
6. Abstraction
